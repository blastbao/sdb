# sdb - a simple database

sdb is an ambitious project to make our own RDB from scratch, without using external library (including some data structures like LRU or B-Tree, interpretation of SQL, etc).

It should not use external library except Go standard libraries.
Right now, it is using go-test/deep for the unit testing, but it will be replaced in the near future.
